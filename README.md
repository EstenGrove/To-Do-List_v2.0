To-Do List v2.0

-This is a simple project using object-oriented javascript  and ES6 to build a to-do list that tracks and saves a variety of different pieces of data in relation to the saved task. For example:
    -Date Created
    -Expiration Date
    -Task Category(i.e. Personal or Work-Related)
    -And of the course the task itself(Ex. Do laundry, Change oil etc.)

The data and tasks are to be stored using local storage so if the user were to reload the page their list and respective tasks would be saved with all their data.
    -I may consider mapping and storing the data in a database just for the sake of learning to connect and write tables and routines in SQL. 
    -I've considered using MongoDB or perhaps MariaDB
    
*I figured it wise to build an app that was easy and allowed me to focus primarily on the logic and avoid getting lost in "Design Land" while building it. Additionally, I've successfully built To-Do lists before using functional programming and felt I needed to delve deeper into the world of Object-Oriented.
